/*flex box is rather interesting, because it is designed to work best with collections of elements*/
/*It makes it easy to align elements in a row or column, and to distribute space between them*/

/*Here is an example of how to use flexbox on an element with the class container, and its children with the class item:*/
.container {
    display: flex; /* Use flexbox layout */
    flex-direction: row; /* Arrange items in a row */
    justify-content: center; /* Center items horizontally */
    align-items: center; /* Center items vertically */
}

.item {
    flex: 1; /* Allow items to grow and shrink equally */
    margin: 10px; /* Add margin around each item */
    padding: 20px; /* Add padding inside each item */
    background-color: #f2f2f2; /* Set background color for each item */
}
